# 5V Regulated Power Supply PCB (KiCad)

This is my first PCB design project, created as part of my learning journey into electronics and embedded hardware design.  
The goal of this project is to design a simple and reliable **5V regulated DC power supply** using the LM7805 voltage regulator.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This circuit converts an **unregulated AC/DC input** into a clean **5V DC output**, commonly used in:
- Embedded systems  
- IoT devices  
- Sensor modules  
- Development boards  

The project includes:
- Bridge rectifier
- Smoothing capacitors
- 7805 voltage regulator
- Input/output screw terminals
- Clean PCB layout with organized routing

## 📚 What I Learned

✨ As this is my **first PCB project**, I learned:
- How to design schematics in KiCad  
- Component placement strategy  
- Routing techniques (THT components)  
- Understanding power paths and grounding  
- Generating Gerber files  
- Debugging DRC errors

This project helped me build a strong foundation for future electronics design work.
